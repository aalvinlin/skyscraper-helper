# skyscraper-helper

This repository contains a short helper program that allows a solver to solve skyscraper puzzles more easily.

When values have been added to the input, hovering over a value will highlight cells in rows and columns that do not contain that value.

Doing so will reduce the amount of time used to repeatedly search squares one-by-one for available spots. Instead, a quick visual glance will provide the same information.
